[Interface]
# Server's private key (generate with: wg-keygen genkey)
PrivateKey = <server-private-key>

# UDP port to listen on
ListenPort = 51820

# IP addresses assigned to the server's tunnel interface
# IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (comma-separated)
Address = 10.0.0.1/24, fd00:vpn::1/64

# Optional: Set MTU (default is 1420)
# MTU = 1420

# Example peer configuration
# Each [Peer] section represents a client that can connect

[Peer]
# Client's public key (the client runs: wg-keygen pubkey < private.key)
PublicKey = <client-1-public-key>

# Optional: Pre-shared key for additional security
# PresharedKey = <psk>

# IP addresses this peer is allowed to have (their tunnel IP)
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32, fd00:vpn::2/128

# Optional: If the client is behind NAT, send keepalive packets
# PersistentKeepalive = 25

# Add more peers as needed:
# [Peer]
# PublicKey = <client-2-public-key>
